# React + Vite Starter Template

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

> **Note:** For production applications, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get this project running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AdminVelesium/TMS.git
cd TMS-main
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

Then run:

```sh
npm install
```

This will install all required dependencies for the project.

### 3. Start the Development Server

To run the project in development mode with hot reloading:

```sh
npm run dev
```

After running the above command, you should see output similar to:

```
  VITE vX.X.X  ready in 300 ms

  ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ‚ûú  Network: use --host to expose
```

Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to view your React app.

## üì¶ Production Build

To build the app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder with your optimized production build.

To preview the production build locally:

```sh
npm run preview
```
