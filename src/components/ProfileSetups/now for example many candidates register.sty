now for example many candidates register then it will be difficult to fetch a specific profile
I will provide a workflow just try to implement it 
After succes signup navigate to profile setup page then after success profile page completion navigate to login page the after success login then navigate to the candidate profile page but 
1. after signup create a bucket with a unique id in the mongodb database which will hold the signup/login credentials and that candidates profile details
2. after login fetch the bucket and then fetch the candidate profile details from the bucket
3. if the candidate profile details is not found then navigate to the Signup page
4. if the candidate profile details is found then navigate to the candidate profile page of that respective candidate

Signup->profilesetup->login->candidateprofile
so there will be multiple candidates signing up and creating profiles, for every signup create a bucket with a unique id in the mongodb database which will hold the signup/login credentials and that candidates profile details
and when the candidate login then find the bucket id and then fetch the candidate profile details from the bucket of that respective candidate
